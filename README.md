# Taximeter

Android application that simulates a taximeter, calculating fares dynamically based on distance, time, and additional charges like luggage.

üíª Requirements and Getting Started
-----------------------------------

Java 17 and Android Studio Flamingo or later are required.

To build it locally:

Use ./gradlew assembleDebug to build it, or run it directly in Android Studio.

Use ./gradlew test to execute unit tests locally.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
---------------

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with a modularized approach, incorporating MVI, Use Cases, and Repository patterns.

### Project Structure

 - **features**: Contains core functionalities of the taximeter.
 - **domain**: Business logic, independent from the platform.
 - **data**: Implements repositories and data sources.
 - **libraries**: Shared modules that provide reusable components.
 - **build-logic**: Custom Gradle setup to modularize dependency management.

üìö Libraries Included
